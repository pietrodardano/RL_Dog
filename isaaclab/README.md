# **IsaacLab Reference Guide**

IsaacLab scripts rely on importing various **modules**, **classes**, **assets**, and **functions** to operate effectively. Here's how the system handles these imports:

- The system references files located within the **`IsaacLab` directory**.
- On **Linux systems**, this directory is typically found in the **Home folder**.
- It contains the cloned **IsaacLab repository** from **GitHub**.

By maintaining this structure, the software ensures seamless integration and functionality across its components.
